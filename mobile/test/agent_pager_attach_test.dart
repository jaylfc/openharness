/// stream is a claim on that agent's terminal. The pager once kept every agent it had visited, so a
/// lap of the list took them all from the desktop; later it attached two pages either side and kept
/// the last two it left, up to eight at once. One either side is what an instant swipe needs — a
/// swipe goes one page, in either direction — and at most three agents are ever claimed.
